    <h1>How to get involved with SayIt</h1>
</div>

<p>SayIt was built for other people to use. If you’d like to get involved,
here’s where to start. We’re looking for volunteers, whether you have coding
skills or transcripts you’d like to upload.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re technically minded, please read our <a
    href="/about/developers">introduction for developers</a>, which includes
information on the data standard we use for transcripts, how you can help, or
how to install SayIt yourself.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not technically minded, please look
at our <a href="/about/transcripts">guide for getting transcripts online</a>,
and of course please play with our site and let us know
your thoughts.</p>
